# 203 List Applications

## Objectives
* observe the behaviour of math operations on a list
* use the numpy module to work with lists as vectors


### Assignment 1
Just as we saw with numbers (float and int data types) as well as strings, there are some math operators that work.

The following math operators work with numbers:
+,-,*,/,**,//,%

However, there are only 2 math operators that work with strings:
+,*

There are some mathematical operators that work with lists as well.  
**Open up the google document that is included with this assignment and answer the questions provided about math operations with lists**

### Assignment 2
We are going to import a module called **numpy** and make use of a function called **np.array**.
**Open up the google document that is included with this assignment, and answer the questions provided about math operations with numpy.arrays.

### Assignment 3
Represent each system of linear equations as a pair of np.array vectors.

### Assignment 4
Write a function that will take a np.array vector and a column and return a reduced row vector.

### Assignment 5
Solve the system of linear equations with row reduction (did you pay attention to the video on matrix algebra?)
